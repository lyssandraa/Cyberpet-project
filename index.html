          You are now a proud owner of a virtual pet of your choice. Your main
          task is to take great care of it!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Once you have read through these instructions, you will get the chance
          to pick your pet. There are three level options: <br />
          Level 1 is easy mode; your pet does not require too much care.
          <br />Level 2 is medium; your pet requires a little more attention.
          <br />Level 3 is hard mode; your pet needs constant handling.
          <br />Whichever level you choose, remember to give your pet loads of
          love, rest and food!
